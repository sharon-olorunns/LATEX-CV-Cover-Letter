                        \item  The project was to construct an application to explore data on property transactions in processing. The data set we will use is from the UK Land Registry. The application will read in data from a file “pricepaid.csv”, render it, and allow the user to interact with it. 
 \item I was responsible for the User Interface Design and for adding the Map API to the app\\*

                        \item Basic 3D rendering with orthographic projection, simple triangle rasterization, z-buffering and flat shading. I will not be focusing on heavy performance optimizations and more complex topics like textures or different lighting setups \\*
